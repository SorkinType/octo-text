kinds of dashes in use

¶ The majority1 (European languages) — including English2 in
the UK — treats dashes similarly. In a sentence, the standard
form is an en-dash3 with one space on either side4.
Nevertheless, there are exceptions, notably in Spanish: they
prefer em-dashes5 and treat them —although6 it may look
weird— as brackets that touch the words inside, (...) in some
languages the en-dash7 and em-dash are considered
replaceable. The US way—long8 em-dashes without spaces—
is also common in Australia and Canada9.
